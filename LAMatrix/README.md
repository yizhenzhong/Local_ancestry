## LAMatrix: Efficient eQTL Mapping with Local Ancestry

*LAMatrix* is an [R](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29) package for efficient eQTL mapping while adjusting for local ancestry (or any SNP-specific covariates) with a linear model.

*LAMatrix* is developed based on [*MatrixEQTL*](https://github.com/andreyshabalin/MatrixEQTL); therefore, these two packages share the same input formats and most functions.

## Installation
```r
library(devtools)
install_github("yizhenzhong/Local_ancestry/LAMatrix")
